ARRAY-3:

YOU ARE GIVEN ARRAY.AND A EQUATION WHERE a[i]=GCD(i,j) ,where i!=j,  
IF THE GCD(i,j) IS EQUAL TO i th index then a[i] value becomes its previous value of a[i].
YOU HAVE CHECK ALL THE VALUES IN THE ARRAY OR EQUAL OR NOT. IF ALL VALUES ARE EQUAL THEN PRINT “YES” ELSE PRINT “NO”.

CONSTRAINTS: 1=<a.length()<=10
             a[i]<=9999
             i!=j,
             gcd(i,j)>=1
             testcases<=10

INPUT: FIRST LINE CONSISTS OF TESTCASES
       Second line consists of n followed n integers of array.

OUTPUT: output  a line ”YES” else “NO”.

SAMPLE INPUT:
1
3
3 2 3

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
YES
