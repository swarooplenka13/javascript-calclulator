Maximum area of rectangle:

rahul wants to draw four line segments on a sheet of paper. He wants the i-th segment to have its length equal to ai (1=<ai<=4). 
These segments can intersect with each other, and each segment should be either horizontal or vertical.
if rahul wants to draw the segments in such a way that they enclose a rectangular space, and the area of that rectangular space should be maximum possible.

CONSTRAINTS: You will be given four line segments(1<=ai<=4)
              where each segment s is  1<=s<=1000
              test cases<=10

INPUT: FIRST LINE CONSISTS OF TESTCASES
       Second line consists of 4 list of integers

OUTPUT: output a single integer of maximum area of rectangle

Sample case:

Input: 1 
       1 2 3 4

Output: 3
