MAGIC CIRCLE:
 
U ARE GIVEN A CIRCLE CENTRE AND A SQUARE OF THE RADIUS OF THE CIRCLE, AND U ARE GIVEN SINGLE SET OF POINT.
THE CIRCLE IS MAGIC CIRCLE IF THE GIVEN POINT LIES IN INTERIOR REGION OF THE CIRCLE.
CHECK WHETHER IT IS A MAGIC CIRCLE OR NOT.
IF IT IS A MAGIC CIRCLE PRINT “YES” ELSE PRINT “NO”.

CONSTRAINTS:
             CENTER=(X,Y)>=(1,1)
              R^2>=2
             POINT(X1,Y1)>=(2,2)
             testcases<=10.

INPUT :
FIRST LINE CONSISTS OF NO. TEST CASES.
SECOND LINE CONSISTS CENTRE, SQUARE OF RADIUS OF CIRCLE.
NEXT LINE CONSISTS OF SINGLE SET OF POINT.

OUTPUT:
output  a line ”YES” else “NO”.

NOTE : inputs can be of float types.

SAMPLE INPUT:
1
2 3 2 2 4

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
 YES
